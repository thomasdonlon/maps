# MAPS (Measuring Accelerations with Pulsating Stars)
## v1.1.0
Pipeline written in python to reduce pulsating variable star data. Takes in observed light curve data and computes periods for the star as a function of time, which can be turned into an acceleration measurement. 

Heavily under development. 

The current implementation (v1.1) is consistent with the description in Donlon et al. (subm)
