 - automatic determination of period if fund. period is not in fft (happens if period is smaller than sample frequency/2, like it can be in delta scutis etc)
 	- probably divide by # peaks in folded light curve (recursively?) until # peaks = 1
 	- then do a low-res optimization around that 
 	- this is probably only necessary for very small period stars like KIC 7106205
